## In Memoriam

This project was named *tor* in memory of my once teammate and forever friend **Denis Letor**. He was the person who made me discover devops and public cloud. He was one of the most friendly and joyful guys I ever met. He passed away from COVID-19 on Dec 15th 2021 leaving a wife and three kids down here. When we worked together, we used to say every time we had a problem, "we need to call Letor", that was a pun on his last name. In French, he was Belgian, this translates to "We have to call the tor". And he always had an idea. Hope this other tor will help solve some of your problems too.

Rest in peace my dear friend.
